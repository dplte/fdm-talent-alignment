The Global Partnership Sales Engine (GPSE) Team is an integral part of creating efficiency and scale in support of our publisher business generation and platform solutions. The GPSE team is designed to accelerate operational activities and centralize work (e.g., operational activities like reporting, implementation and optimization) away from the sales teams so that they can concentrate the efforts on client-specific activities.

As a data analyst on the GPSE team, you will have the opportunity to work with an extensive range of cross-functional teams on the Global Partnerships side of the business, to further evolve and scale GPSE support. This requires excellent stakeholder management (ensure customer and stakeholder expectations are understood, met, and managed), data analysis, communication and ability to lead projects/case work separately.
